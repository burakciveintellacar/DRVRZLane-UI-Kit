# HamburgerIcon

A neat hamburger menu icon. Not a lot to using it:

## Usage
```

  onClick={someFunction}
/>
```

## HamburgerIcon props
#### `onClick: function`
Function called whenever the HamburgerIcon is actually clicked. Please note that
the HamburgerIcon keeps track of its own open/close state.
